    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dark hot chocolate drink was created when I was craving hot cocoa but I only had dark chocolate on hand. I added cinnamon for a festive touch. Pour into a mug and top with whipped cream or marshmallows, if desired. Serve hot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 Â½ teaspoons brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 ounces dark chocolate (70% or more cocoa butter), or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until just before boiling, 3 to 4 minutes. Add brown sugar and stir until dissolved, about 1 minute. Stir dark chocolate into milk until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove saucepan from heat and stir cream and cinnamon into milk mixture. Serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
